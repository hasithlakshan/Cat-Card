# Cat-Card

fetching the cat images and Binding these images together into one image and finally, that will save as one image.

# Technologies

    • Node.js(14.17.0)

# Project set up

    • clone and redirect to Cat-Card
    • npm install
    • npm start

# To improve
    • We can convert this to node API with a web application framework like express js and return it as an image bind API. Then the client can pass the two images and merge. So they can merge images using this API.
    • If we build this more and more we have to improve this folder structure as well, like making controllers models etc..
    • If need to improve as an API we have to think about the security feature as well we can sanitize requests,  we can Tokenization every request, etc.
